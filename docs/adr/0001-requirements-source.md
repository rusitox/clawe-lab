# ADR 0001 — Requirements come from Rusitox

## Context
We are operating an agentic software engineering process.

## Decision
Only requirements explicitly provided by **Rusitox** are considered product requirements.

## Consequences
- Agents may propose ideas, but must not implement them as product features without explicit approval.
- Work items should trace back to an Issue or request from Rusitox.
